**Ph.D. Candidate, Mechanical Engineering**  
Johns Hopkins University · Baltimore, MD

I am a Ph.D. student working on multiscale modeling and experimental mechanics of materials under extreme pressure and temperature conditions. My research integrates in-situ imaging, high-pressure testing, and finite-element modeling to study material compaction, damage evolution, and reliability.
